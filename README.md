This is one of six homework assignments assigned by Professor Lowenthal in Brooklyn College's Data Structures class during the Fall 2012 semester.  I can't vouch for the quality of the code, and I will note that it's heavily influenced by my experiences with Objective-C, but it's thoroughly commented and should be clean enough. 

This assignments exercises concepts revolving around binary trees, and instructs students to create and manipulate them. As with the previous assignments, details are [in my iCloud Photo Stream, here](https://www.icloud.com/photostream/#A1532ODWBszbz).

Same policy applies to this as to the last ones. You may reference my code, just don't use it to cheat on homework.
